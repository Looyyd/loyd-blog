# Introduction

There are certain fundamental values that seem to be embedded in the very laws of the universe. These "primordial values" are not just human constructs, but principles that shape the dynamics of all complex systems. I argue that any ideology or social contract that fails to take them into account will struggle to survive in the long run, like a swimmer fighting against the tide.
The challenges faced by the effective altruism movement illustrate this point. Despite its admirable intentions to do the most good possible through reason and evidence, the movement has been criticized for its vulnerability to exploitation by bad actors like Sam Bankman-Fried. By focusing solely on altruism without safeguards against individual self-interest, the movement neglected the primordial will to power of its members.
In this essay, I will explore two key primordial values: veracity and will to power. By understanding these values as fundamental principles and giving them the same weight as other human values, we can develop more robust and resilient frameworks for human flourishing.

# Veracity

Veracity, or the pursuit of truth, is the first primordial value. It is the commitment to aligning our beliefs and actions with objective reality, even when it is uncomfortable or inconvenient. Without a dedication to veracity, we cannot reliably predict the consequences of our choices or make informed decisions.
The history of lobotomy illustrates the dangers of neglecting veracity. This harmful surgical procedure persisted for decades, despite causing severe damage to patients, because the medical community failed to rigorously investigate its effects. By prioritizing the perceived benefits over the pursuit of truth, they caused immense and avoidable suffering.
The lesson is clear: veracity must come first. An accurate understanding of reality is the foundation upon which all other values and goals must be built. Organizations and individuals that prioritize convenient fictions over uncomfortable truths are building on quicksand.

# Will to Power

The second primordial value is the will to power - the drive to grow, influence, and shape one's environment. In human systems, power is the fundamental tool that enables us to translate intentions into reality. Without sufficient leverage, even the noblest values will struggle to find expression in the world.
For individuals, the will to power is an innate drive, rooted in the evolutionary imperatives of survival and reproduction. It manifests as the pursuit of self-interest and the desire to expand one's influence. In contrast, organizations must actively cultivate a will to power by aligning the incentives of their members with the goals of the collective.
The Soviet Union illustrates the consequences of failing to cultivate this alignment. While the state wielded enormous power, it failed to account for the self-interest of individuals, who pursued their own agendas through deception and inefficiency. This misalignment ultimately undermined the effectiveness of the entire system.
On the other hand, an underfunded charity may have a unified purpose but lack the power to make an impact. Without resources and influence, even the most aligned group will struggle to achieve its goals. The absence of a will to power, in this case, stems from a lack of capacity rather than misalignment.
The implication is that effective organizations must both cultivate a will to power and ensure that it is aligned with the motivations of their members. Incentive structures must harness self-interest in service of collective goals, while also accumulating the forms of power needed to shape the external world.

# Conclusion
Veracity and will to power may not be typically recognized as human values, but they are fundamental forces that shape the dynamics of all social systems. Organizations and ideologies that fail to grapple with these realities will face existential challenges, like organisms ignoring the laws of physics or biology.
To thrive in the long run, human systems must prioritize three things. First, a commitment to truth-seeking over comforting illusions. Second, the accumulation of power and leverage to translate intentions into reality. Third, an alignment of individual incentives with collective goals, harnessing the innate human drive for self-interest.
By designing our systems and strategies around these primordial values, we can create more robust, adaptive, and effective organizations. We can ground our idealism in a realistic appraisal of the forces that shape human behavior. And we can channel the fundamental currents of nature towards the ends we seek, rather than being swept away by them.
