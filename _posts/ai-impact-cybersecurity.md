# Introduction

The world of cybersecurity is constantly changing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is shaking things up even more. It's helping organizations tackle threats more effectively, and as a result, it's crucial to understand how AI might change the cybersecurity workforce landscape. Most people talk about factors like task complexity, social and emotional intelligence, and the balance between routine and non-routine tasks in different job roles when they try to estimate the impact of AI. While these aspects are important, they might not show us the full picture.

In this blog post, we're going to take a different approach to analyze AI's impact on the cybersecurity workforce. Instead of looking at the usual factors, we'll dive into the fundamental relationship between productivity, workforce size, and demand. By focusing on this simple formula, we can get a better idea of how AI-driven productivity improvements could shape the future of the cybersecurity workforce.

The Formula: Productivity * Workforce = Demand

To kick things off, we'll use the following formula as our starting point:

Productivity * Workforce = Demand

This straightforward equation highlights the core relationship between productivity (output per worker), the size of the workforce, and the overall demand for a particular job or industry. By exploring how AI-driven productivity improvements and changing demand influence this relationship, we can gain valuable insights into the potential effects of AI on the cybersecurity workforce.

Of course, using this formula the Evolution of workforce can be estimated by the evolution of demand and the evolution of productivity.

# Impact on Productivity of a General Technology: ChatGPT

ChatGPT stands out from other technologies due to its ability to enhance the productivity of all knowledge workers, including cybersecurity professionals. This versatile AI-driven language model can assist with various tasks, such as research, drafting documents, providing suggestions, and even automating certain processes.

## Estimating Productivity Improvement with ChatGPT

To estimate the productivity improvement brought by ChatGPT, we'll consider its current capabilities without additional plugins or enhancements. Based on personal experience and observations, using ChatGPT and other LLM (Large Language Model) based technologies can lead to productivity improvements ranging from 30% to 100%. For our analysis, we will take a conservative estimation of 65%.

# Estimating Demand

Estimating the demand for cybersecurity is a challenging task. On one hand, software security is becoming more mature, leading to a reduced likelihood of cyberattacks. However, as software takes on increasingly critical tasks, the potential impact of cyberattacks grows. Additionally, new threats and attack vectors are continuously emerging, which could counterbalance the maturation of software security. To simplify the estimation, we will assume that cybersecurity demand is proportional to the amount of software written.

## Estimating Software Production Capacity

As software remains crucial for advancements in automation, AI tools, and other emerging technologies, the current demand for software is likely not met. According to a report by the US Labor Department, the global shortage of software engineers may reach 85.2 million by 2030. Furthermore, around 40 million technical jobs go unfulfilled due to a lack of skilled talent. This unmet demand suggests that the amount of software written is constrained by software production capacity, which depends on the size of the programmer workforce and their productivity.

## Impact of ChatGPT on Software Output

With the productivity improvements brought by ChatGPT, the amount of software written is expected to increase by approximately 65%.

# Estimating the Overall Impact of ChatGPT on the Cybersecurity Workforce

To estimate the total impact of ChatGPT on the cybersecurity workforce, we can use the following equation:

Cybersecurity_workforce_change = Demand/Productivity = Amount_of_software_written/Productivity_of_cybersecurity_field

Plugging in our values, we get:

(Developer_workforce_change * Productivity_of_developer)/Productivity_of_cybersecurity_field = (Developer_workforce_change * 165)/165 = Developer_workforce_change

$$\frac{(Developer\_workforce\_change \times Productivity\_of\_developer)}{Productivity\_of\_cybersecurity\_field} = \frac{(Developer\_workforce\_change \times 165)}{165} = Developer\_workforce\_change$$

$Cybersecurity\_workforce\_change = \frac{Demand}{Productivity} = \frac{Amount\_of\_software\_written}{Productivity\_of\_cybersecurity\_field}$



Based on our estimations, ChatGPT should not have a significant impact on cybersecurity jobs. This conclusion assumes that the demand for cybersecurity will increase proportionally with the growth in software output, without factoring in potential changes in the threat landscape, technology adoption rates, or cybersecurity maturity. However, it is essential to consider these additional factors when evaluating the true impact of ChatGPT and other productivity-enhancing technologies on the cybersecurity workforce.

# Closing Thoughts: Adapting to the Impact of Specialized AI Applications

In conclusion, although our analysis suggests that ChatGPT technology may not significantly affect the overall number of cybersecurity jobs, it is important to recognize that it will still have a profound impact on the nature of these jobs. As productivity-enhancing technologies like ChatGPT continue to evolve, they are likely to reshape the roles and responsibilities of cybersecurity professionals.

Additionally, we must remain cautious about more specialized AI applications that focus solely on improving the productivity of cybersecurity professionals. These specialized tools could potentially reduce the demand for cybersecurity jobs, as they enable fewer professionals to handle the same workload.

Ultimately, it is crucial for cybersecurity professionals and other workers in niche fields to be aware of the potential risks posed by AI and automation. By continuously educating themselves, staying informed about industry trends, and adapting to the changing landscape, these professionals can better position themselves for success in a rapidly evolving job market. This proactive approach can help ensure that advancements in AI and automation contribute positively to the workforce, giving skilled professionals more agency and control over their careers in the face of disruptive technological changes.
